1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
When you want to compare things with a criteria to see if it meets the criteria given.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
Reach out for help sooner. I was one small error from an answer and waited an hour to reach out for help.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Finding a method that was completely alien to me and getting a result that worked. I tried to read how to do it instead of just looking for an answer.
